## Where did 2022 go?

2022 was a quiet year for the project as I personally had significant changes in my life. I thought I'd note this so you know the project isn't dead.

Addtionally I've been running the code in my own organisation during this period with zero issues. The nuGet packages used in this project also didn't have any significant releases (security related or otherwise). Hence this didn't create any pressing need to spend time on the project.

But I'm now back. I've included some version minor fixes in the latest release which improve handling of exceptions for the client. For this only affects the admins as I deploy the "service only' MSI to client PCs.
